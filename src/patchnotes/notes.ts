/**
 * PATCH NOTES.
 *
 * One list, newest first, and the only place a version number is written down
 * in this project. The client reads it, `CHANGELOG.md` is rendered from it
 * (`npm run changelog`), and `VERSION` below is whatever sits at the top — so
 * a release can never ship with three different opinions about what it is.
 *
 * The rule for what goes in an entry: it must be something a player could
 * notice. Refactors, build plumbing and test harnesses do not belong here
 * unless they changed what happens on screen.
 *
 * Versions before 1.1.0 are assigned retroactively from the commit history —
 * the project shipped continuously before it started numbering itself, and
 * inventing a paper trail would be worse than saying so.
